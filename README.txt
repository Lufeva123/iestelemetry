The step to get this program running are

-Compile the program
-Install the rxtx serial library
-Install a serial port
-Give the user permission to access the serial port
-Run the program

-------------------------
**COMPILING THE PROGRAM**
-------------------------

To compile, make sure that a java sdk version of at least 1.6 is installed
and that the jar archive tool is installed.

You can check by opening a terminal or command window and typing "javac -version"
you should see something like "javac 1.6.0_65"

Type "jar" and your screen should scroll with many jar options.

If the above fails, search for how to install the latest Java Development Kit or "JDK" 
for your operating system.

Oracle has binaries for all of the major platforms, however, linux users may
want to use OpenJDK.

When you list the contents of the directory, you should see the following.

lib                   - directory containing libraries  
librxtxSerial.jnilib  - java serial library for OSX (here for convenience but may not work)
LICENSE               - GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE version 3
makeit.bat            - batch script to compile and archive the program 
makeit.sh             - bash  script to compile and archive the program 
manifest.txt          - info that will be added to the manifest in the resulting jar file
README.md             - description of the program
README.txt            - this document
rxtxSerial.dll        - java serial library for 32/64 bit Microsoft Windows (here for convenience but may not work)
src                   - directory with source files.


In Windows run makeit.bat in linux/unix run makeit.sh .
In linux/unix you will have to make makeit.sh executable.
To make it executable type

"chmod +x makeit.sh"

When done compiling, the ftp program will be placed in the dist directory.


--------------------------------------
**INSTALLING THE RXTX SERIAL LIBRARY**
--------------------------------------
RXTX is a Java library, using a native implementation (via JNI), providing 
serial and parallel communication for the Java Development Toolkit (JDK). 
http://rxtx.qbang.org/
Without this library, the program will not be able to communicate with
the serial port.


---------------------------------
**INSTALLING RXTX UNDER WINDOWS**
---------------------------------

Make sure that the "rxtxSerial.dll" file is in the classpath.
This file can be placed where your version of java keeps its libraries
or "C:\Windows\System32"


-------------------------------
**INSTALLING RXTX UNDER LINUX**
-------------------------------

The distribution you are using should have this available via one of its repositories.
under ubuntu 14.04 open a terminal and type

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install librxtx-java

This will install the rxtx library. things should be similar under other
distributions. For RHEL 6/7 a specific repository has to be added and a link
to the library has to be made in /lib

-----------------------------
**INSTALLING RXTX UNDER OSX**
-----------------------------
copy the "librxtxSerial.jnilib" file to 
"/Library/Java/Extensions" directory
Note, you may have to hunt around for a version of this library
compiiled for the version of OSX you are using.
You could also compile rxtx from source.



By this point the program should run even though you may not have a properly installed 
serial port yet.

----------------------------
**INSTALLING A SERIAL PORT**
----------------------------

This program communicates with the deck boxes via an RS232 serial interface.
You must first make sure that a serial port is available and functioning 
under your operating system before attempting to communicate with a deck box.

Serial ports are rarely included with computers these days but one can
purchase inexpensive USB to RS232 serial adapters for this.
Under linux most of these adapters work out of the box without the need to install drivers.

Under Windows and OSX, drivers must be installed.


Once installed you can verify that the operating system has mounted the usb to serial converter.

Under linux the device should be listed in the dev folder as something like this
"/dev/ttyUSB0" 

Under OSX the device should be listed in the dev folder as something like this
"/dev/cu.usbserial"
"/dev/tty.usbserial"

Under Windows, the serial port should be listed in device manager under Ports(COM & LPT)
as something like this

"Communications Port (COM1)"



-----------------------------------------
**PERMISSIONS TO ACCESS THE SERIAL PORT**
-----------------------------------------

-----------------
**UNDER WINDOWS**
-----------------
The serial ports should already be available for use by the user.

---------------
**UNDER LINUX**
---------------

On ubuntu and other distributions, the user running the program
will not have access to serial ports unless the user is part of the
"dialout" group.

For example, to add user aardvark to the dialout group, open a terminal and type
sudo usermod -a -G dialout aardvark (replace aardvark with the username)

logout and log back in. 

To list groups the current user is part of, type

groups

dialout should be in the list.

-------------
**UNDER OSX**
-------------

Access to the serial port is a little more complicated under OSX as it changes across
several different versions.

These instructions worked under OSX Leopard 10.5

sudo mkdir /var/lock 
sudo chmod 775 /var/lock
sudo dscl . -append /groups/_uucp GroupMembership aardvark (replace aardvark with the username)

rxtx uses the /var/lock directory to create lock files for a serial port when in use.
This prevents other programs from trying to use the serial port when in use.
You will likely have trouble at this point. If you have trouble and you figure it out,
please include what you did in this document.

peruse "http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Trouble_shooting#Mac_OS_X_users" for hints.

If you can't figure it out, you can run the program as the super user by preceding the command
by "sudo"

"sudo java -jar IESTelemetry.jar"

This will work but all the files created by the program will belong to root and you will
have to change the permissions of the created files to access them.

-----------------------
**RUNNING THE PROGRAM**
-----------------------

To run the program enter the dist directory and type.

"java -jar IESTelemetry.jar"

If your Operating system assosciates the jar files with the java virtual machine,
you may be able to just double click on "IESTelemetry.jar" to execute it.


Keep the IESTelemetry.jar file and the lib folder together.
You can create a directory like "dist" and copy IESTelemetry.jar and the lib folder into it.
